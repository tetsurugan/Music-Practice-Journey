        Hey let me give you some tips on becoming a better musician with  my thoughts
        on music theory.  Late last year I bought two vsts for my Daw I use reason 12. 
        But the thing is with me buying these 2 vsts to improve my sound catalogue, I spend
        a couple hours a day going through the sounds and seeing which ones I like. The ones I like
        get starred right now.  The 2 programs i'm using are Komplete 14 standard edition and I also bought
        the Belladonne arturia collection. While I am  going through these sounds and it might take a While
        i well share some knowledge about music that ive picked up throughout the years. I will also
        get into the directoin im headed with practice when im done to help you go from just playing around
        to making songs.  Let's go on this path together, lets start the countdown of making music.
